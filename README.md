**The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) in flutter pattern:**

**Flutter MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** is an architectural pattern that is used to separate the user interface (View) from the business logic and data (Model) of an application, while also providing a clear separation of concerns. Here's how you can implement the MVVM pattern in Flutter:

**Model:** This represents the data and business logic of your app. You can create classes that define your data and perform operations on that data.
View: This represents the user interface of your app. You can create widgets that display your data and respond to user input.

**ViewModel:** This acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It exposes data and operations from the Model to the View, and it also receives input from the View and updates the Model accordingly.

The ViewModel is responsible for maintaining the state of the View and communicating changes to the View. It also provides a way for the View to interact with the Model without directly accessing it.

_You can implement the MVVM pattern in Flutter using various architectural patterns, such as Provider, or BLoC (Business Logic Component) with StreamBuilder. These patterns allow you to separate the presentation layer (View) from the business logic and data (Model) and provide a clear separation of concerns, making your code more modular, testable, and maintainable._
